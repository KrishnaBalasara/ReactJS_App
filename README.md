## Downloading, Extracting, and Running a React Project

### Download and Extract the Project:

1. Download ZIP File:

   - Visit this project's repository.
   - Look for the "Code" button and select "Download ZIP".
   - Save the ZIP file to a location on your computer.

2. Extract the Project:

   - Locate the downloaded ZIP file and right-click on it.
   - Choose "Extract" or "Extract All" to unzip the contents.
   - Select a destination folder for the extracted project files.

### Install Node.js and NPM:

1. Download Node.js:

   - Visit [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) in your web browser.
   - Download the "LTS" version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
   - Run the downloaded installer.

2. Run the Node.js Installer:

   - Follow the installation prompts.
   - You can generally accept the default settings.
   - The installer will also install NPM (Node Package Manager) alongside Node.js.

3. Verify Installation:

   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Check the installed versions with these commands:
   
     `node -v`
     `npm -v`
     
You should see the version numbers displayed, confirming the installation.

### Run the Project:

1. Navigate to Project Directory:

   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Use the `cd` command to move to the directory where you extracted the project:
   
      `cd path/to/extracted/project`
    
2. Install Project Dependencies:

   - In the project directory, run the following command to install the required dependencies:
   
      `npm install`

3. Start the Development Server:

   - After the dependencies are installed, start the development server:
   
      `npm start`
   
     This will launch the server and automatically open the project in your default web browser.

4. Access the Project:

   - Open your web browser and enter `http://localhost:3000` in the address bar.
   - You should see the React project running locally.

Remember that each step is crucial, and it's important to ensure that all installations and commands are executed accurately. If you encounter any issues, refer to the project's documentation or community for assistance.


## Running React Project on Your Mobile Device

1. Connect Both Devices:

   - Ensure your computer and mobile are on the same Wi-Fi network.

2. Find Computer's IP:

   - Open terminal/command prompt on your computer.
   - Use `ipconfig` (Windows) or `ifconfig` (macOS/Linux) to find your local IP address.

3. Update Project Configuration:

   - Locate the project's `package.json` file.
   - Modify the `start` script to use your computer's IP address:

     "scripts": {
       "start": "react-scripts start --host your-computer-ip"
     }
   
4. Restart Development Server:

   - In the project folder's terminal, stop server (if running).
   - Start server with `npm start`.

5. Access on Mobile:

   - On your mobile's browser, enter `http://your-computer-ip:3000`.

6. Test Responsiveness:

   - Check project's appearance and behavior on mobile.
   - Use browser dev tools to simulate various devices.

This lets you see how your React project behaves on smaller screens, helping catch potential issues early.
